A bot that creates a better Blend.

### What problem does it solve?

Spotify's Blend does not update frequently enough, moreover the playlist _tries_ to find neutral ground between taste of
two people.

Instead of fancy algorithms, there should be an easy way to build a playlist for two people (even of
different musical taste) from their recently listened songs. Such playlist should update frequently.

Each person should have equal number of songs in the playlist.
